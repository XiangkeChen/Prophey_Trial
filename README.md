MSBA Market Trend Project - Time Series Forecasting with Prophet in Python  
Prophet is a forecasting tool available in Python and R designed to “make it easier for experts and non-experts to make high quality forecasts that keep up with demand”. Prophet utilizes an additive regression model that analyzes historical data to identify seasonal trends, shifting holidays, and other trend anomalies. What this means in practice is that teams can feed historical data into Prophet and receive a highly accurate organic forecast. Teams can then manually adjust these forecasts for growth limitations or other irregular factors as they see fit.
